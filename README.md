#These are finite-difference method numerical solvers for common PDEs encountered in physics. 
#I wrote them in 2017 for a senior thesis in physics at Old Dominion University in 2017, the paper of which is available on thomaswricks.com. 
#they are heavily commented within the code itself, and were a means of teaching myself Python, where my previous computational physics exposure had been in C++. 
#Doubtlessly they can be improved, and work in such is ongoing.
